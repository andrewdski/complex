Implementation of Complex numbers in Rust

I was learning Rust by reading through
[_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
and decided I'd had enough and should learn by doing. I
found this in [Karan's Mega Project list](https://github.com/karan/Projects)
and decided to start here.

It wasn't my original intention to implement overloaded operators for Complex numbers,
but that turns out to be very easy to do in Rust. This isn't a library because I haven't
learned how to do that yet. Anyway, this has served the purpose of learning more about
Rust.
